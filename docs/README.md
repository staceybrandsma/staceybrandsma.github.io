## Senior Data Scientist ~ Amgen
_July 2021 to present_\
As a technical leader on the R&D AI Strategy & Execution team, I work on several projects across
the company, particularly in precision medicine and obesity.  I am also a leader in several 
key initiatives to build community at Amgen, facilitating upskilling and collaboration across the company.  \
\
Leadership & Strategic Planning:
- Co-lead of AI Taskforce for Obesity & Weight Management. 
- Co-lead of AI Learning Lab for R&D employees across Amgen. 
- SME for Data Science and Precision Medicine strategy at Amgen, participating in workshops and taskforces to define the future of precision medicine at Amgen.  

Techical Lead:
<!-- - Technical lead on new precision medicine initiative for Obesity and weight loss therapeutic area at Amgen.  -->
- Data Science Engagement Team Lead for Digital Health in key pipeline products such as obesity and small-cell lung cancer. I led the ideation process to develop use cases for data science in obesity trials and am now building the use cases into proof of concepts.  Additionally, our team evaluated and recommended digital health products and patient registries for improving retention and data collection in a trial setting. This set the stage for the AI Taskforce for Obesity & Weight Management.
- Tech lead for project to develop competitive intelligence for executives by building models for news summarization, question/answering, topic modelling, senitiment analysis, and financial forecasting.  In this project I held numerous roles including Product Owner, Technical and Team Lead, and Developer.  My work has been recognized by CFO, CIO, VPs, and Directors across Amgen.
- Helped develop and improve a machine learning pipeline for clinical trial optimization and site selection.
- Advised business partners on expansion and roll out of production model for Osteoporosis detection.
- Ingested computer vision pipeline for ingesting cell painting images for cell phenotype changes into Amgen's technical processes.

Collaboration & Community Building:
- Vice Chair of organizing committee for annual Data Science Symposium at Amgen.  I secured an external keynote speaker and moderated fireside and panel discussions.  Facilitated event for nearly 500 Amgen employees.
- Leader and facilitator of the mentoring program.  I built a matching software to streamline the mentor matching process, saving hundreds of work hours and improving matching.
- Mentor and manager of junior staff and ambassador for data science across Amgen, facilitating symposiums, journal clubs, knowledge sharing sessions, pilots, and lunch and learns.  

### Data Scientist 2 ~ Parsyl
_March 2021 - July 2021_\
I led several projects to expand data science across the company,
particularly in the food safety and public health space.  \
Key Projects:
- Built production model for predicting location of facility using IOT devices.
- Deployed and built algorithm for predicting shelf life lost for muscle meat products in the cold chain

### Data Scientist ~ HCA Healthcare
_April 2020 to March 2021_\
I worked on the Clinical Operations Data Science team.  This
involves building production machine learning models and analyses to
improve patient outcomes. \
Key Projects:
- Created and currently maintaining COVID-19 ICU Census models and dashboard.
- Modeled ICU capacity, COVID-19 hospitalizations, and hospital health status.
- Modeled elective surgery appointment recovery at hospitals and surgery centers during COVID-19 pandemic.
- Developed a 30-day readmission classifier model for patients.
- Built pipeline for calculating regional COVID-19 Rt values.
- Built and deployed predictive models for a patientâ€™s hospital visit cost.
- Award: outstanding work during COVID-19 pandemic.

### Data Science Co-Op ~ Johnson & Johnson
_June 2018 to April 2020_\
I worked on the Advanced Analytics Data Science team within J&J.  My
main project was developing a model and visualization for detecting
suspicious orders in controlled pharmaceutical substances.
Additionally, I worked with the the Data Analytics & Acquisition team,
supporting pharmaceuticals, medical devices, and consumer products.\
Key Projects:
- Modelled and visualized anomalies for controlled substances.
- Built shiny app for visualizing advanced statistical concepts to business partners.
- Modelled and predicted promotion timing and efficacy for seasonal consumer products.
- Updated and documented legacy system for monitoring anomalous suture orders.
- Modelled and predicted promotion timing and efficacy for seasonal
  consumer products.
- Assisting in building machine learning models to predict ETA with IoT GPS sensors.
- Assisting in building modeling anomalies for controlled substances.
- Testing and tracking location and battery data from IoT sensors.
- Assisting in the build of a dashboard overview of metrics and current distribution status.

### Monitoring & Evaluation Officer ~ MCC
