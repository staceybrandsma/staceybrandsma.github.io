I  am the Senior Digital AI Product Management Lead for Global Patient Safety at Amgen, where I translate complex safety challenges into scalable, AI-enabled solutions that help protect patients and enhance pharmacovigilance operations. With a foundation in data science and machine learning, I now focus on driving the end-to-end product lifecycle — from strategic planning and problem discovery to solution definition, prototyping, and MVP execution.

My work sits at the intersection of precision medicine, public health, and applied AI, and I’m passionate about bringing innovative digital solutions into real-world practice. Prior to transitioning into product leadership, I spent several years building and deploying machine learning models in healthcare and biotech, experience that continues to inform my product strategy and cross-functional collaboration. I hold Master of Science degrees in both Computer Science and Analytics from Georgia Tech, and a Bachelor of Science in Biology.

# Experience

## Senior Digital AI Product Management Lead ~ Amgen
_February 2025 - present_
As the domain lead for AI product management within Global Patient Safety at Amgen, I am responsible for driving the digital strategy that brings our long-term vision for patient safety to life through technology and innovation. I lead the end-to-end lifecycle of AI product development — from strategic planning and problem discovery to product definition, prototyping, and MVP delivery. My work centers on translating complex safety challenges into scalable, AI-enabled solutions that enhance pharmacovigilance operations and enable more proactive safety decision-making.

Key Initiatives:
- AI-Driven Document Authoring Platform
  - Leading the development of an intelligent, modular system to automate the creation of periodic safety reports and other regulatory safety documents.
  - Leveraging generative AI and document intelligence to reduce manual workload and improve consistency across all safety documentation.

- Safety Assessment Generation Engine
  - Designing a platform that enhances traditional safety signal assessment using AI and data-driven methods.
  - Integrating structured and unstructured data to support faster, more informed signal detection, evaluation, and reporting.

- Safety Risk Prediction & Prevention
  - Building machine learning models to predict product-level safety risks and adverse event likelihood.
  - Identifying causal risk factors in specific patient populations to enable earlier intervention and proactive risk management.
