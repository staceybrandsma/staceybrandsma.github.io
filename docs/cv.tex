I am the Senior Digital AI Product Lead for Global Patient Safety at Amgen, where I drive the strategy and development of AI-enabled solutions to improve pharmacovigilance and patient safety. With a strong foundation in data science and machine learning, I now focus on translating complex safety needs into practical, scalable digital products — from problem discovery through MVP delivery.\\

My work bridges precision medicine, public health, and applied AI. Before moving into product leadership, I spent several years building and deploying machine learning models in healthcare and biotech, a background that continues to shape my approach. I hold MS degrees in Computer Science and Analytics from Georgia Tech, and a BS in Biology.\\
