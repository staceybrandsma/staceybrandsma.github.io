I am a principal data scientist with several years of experience analyzing data and building and deploying machine learning models in large healthcare and biotech companies, with a passion for analyzing data to improve patient's lives.  
My area of interest and expertise is at the intersection between precision medicine, public health, and data science and their applications in improving patient care and treatments.  I have both a Master of Science in Computer Science and Master of Science in Analytics from Georgia Tech, in addition to my Bachelor of Science in Biology. \\
